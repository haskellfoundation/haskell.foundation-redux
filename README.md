# The Haskell Foundation Website

[![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/badge/affiliate-Haskell%20Foundation-purple.svg)](https://haskell.foundation)

This repository is for the [haskell.foundation](https://haskell.foundation) website. It is a proud, Hakyll-based site, built as an in-kind contribution from [Obsidian Systems](https://obsidian.systems), and maintained by the Haskell Foundation and its volunteers. If you would like to get started with a merge request, please consult the documentation below.

## Building


### Nix

To build the project:

```bash
nix-build
```

To run the local development server:

```bash
./watch.sh
```

Alternatively, you can drop into a nix-shell with

```bash
nix-shell
```

And call the website watch command directly via Cabal or Stack:

```bash
cabal run haskell-foundation -- watch
```

### Cabal/Stack

The site can be built locally with Cabal and Stack if the 3rd party dependencies are met, and by issuing the following in terminal:

```base
cabal run haskell-foundation -- watch
```

Or the stack equivalent. For further information, please refer to the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) at the root of this project.
