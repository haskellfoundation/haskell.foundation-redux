/**
 * WARNING: This file will be overwritten when the site is built.
 * Do not put anything in here that is unrelated to tailwind.
 *
 * NOTE: The underlying implementation details of how this works are as follows
 * 1. tailwindcss needs these directives in order to know where to generate the
 *    output
 * 2. first, hackyll is run and will copy this file to
 *    _sites/assets/tailwind.css
 * 3. then, after hackyll is done, postcss will be ran on _this_
 *    assets/tailwind.css file. Postcss will, during execution, invoke
 *    tailwindcss. tailwindcss (the compiler) will scan all the files in the
 *    site for tailwind classes (including _this_ assets/tailwind.css file).
 * 4. postcss's output file is configured to be _site/assets/tailwind.css
 *    (which causes this file to get overwritten with the correct contents)
