Joachim Breitner and David Christiansen interview John MacFarlane, a professor of philosophy at UC Berkeley, but also the author of the popular pandoc document conversion tool, which has been around half as long as Haskell itself.
He also explains the principle of uniformity as a design goal for lightweight markup languages,
the relationship between philosophy and programming, and along the way he helps David with his markdown difficulties.
