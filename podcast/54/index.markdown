In this episode, Wouter and Sam interview Dominic Orchard. Dominic has many roles, including: senior lecturer at the University of Kent, co-director of the Institute of Computing for Climate Science, and bye-fellow of Queen's College in Cambridge. We will not only discuss his work on Granule - graded monads, coeffects, and linear types - but also his collaboration with actual scientists to improve the languages with which they work.
