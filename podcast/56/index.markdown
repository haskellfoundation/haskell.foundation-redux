Today on the Haskell Interlude, Matti and Sam are joined by Satnam Singh. Satnam has been a lecturer at Glasgow, and Software Engineer at Google, Meta, and now Groq. He talks about convincing people to use Haskell, laying out circuits and why community matters.

PS: After the recording, it was important to Satnam to clarify that his advise to “not be afraid to lose your job” was specially meant to encourage to quit jobs that are not good for you, if possible, but he acknowledges that unfortunately not everybody can afford that risk.
